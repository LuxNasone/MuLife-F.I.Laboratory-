# MuLife-F.I.Laboratory
Repository about the measurement of the muon's mean life I made with my lab team in university of Pisa for the Fundamental Interaction Laboratory course. 
The experiment is structered as following: we use cosmic ray muons, detected by 3 scintillators/PMT (telescope) and  stop them in a scintillator block readen by 4 PMT (target). As the muon decays, the electron loses its energy in the material leaving signal. Using another PMT under the block (VETO), some timing module and coincidence unit we can define a START and STOP signal :
